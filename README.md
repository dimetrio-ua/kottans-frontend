# Hello! My name is Dmytro.

I have previously taken web front-end development courses (including Git basics), but now I want to update and strengthen my knowledge so that I can really try to switch to this new kind of work.

### General
 [] 0. [Git Basics]
I've passed Udacity ["Version Control with Git" course](https://learn.udacity.com/courses/ud123).
![This is my progress there](/img/udacity-course-ud123.png)
I like it and I've learned that when you're learning Git, it's not always good to use just the terminal for better understanding. While taking the Udasity course, I also used the GUI **GitKraken**, which not only provides a terminal for entering commands, but also visualizes the commit tree and file folders very well, which helps a lot in learning as well.
*By the way, I didn't really like the **GitHub Desktop** app, as it seemed to me rather limited in functionality and the visual part of the process demonstration.* :smile:

Now I need to pass next levels [here](https://learngitbranching.js.org/).
*As it seems to me, although visually all these colored circles look logical, but the level of understanding of these classes for me personally is worse than the classical course, as was in Udasity, where everything is shown by real examples. As I see it, even the official Git documentation comes out clearer than these exercises. I guess I'm a bit of a retard.*:grimacing:
