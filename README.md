# kottans-frontend

#### Hello! My name is Dmytro. I have previously taken web front-end development courses (including Git basics), but now I want to update and strengthen my knowledge so that I can really try to switch to this new kind of work.

Here is my steps...

# General
  
## Git

1. I've passed Udacity ["Version Control with Git" course](https://learn.udacity.com/courses/ud123).
Here is a progress:

I like it and I've learned that when you're learning Git, it's not always good to use just the terminal for better understanding. While taking the Udasity course, I also used the GUI **GitKraken**, which not only provides a terminal for entering commands, but also visualizes the commit tree and file folders very well, which helps a lot in learning as well.
*By the way, I didn't really like the **GitHub Desktop** app, as it seemed to me rather limited in functionality and the visual part of the process demonstration.* :smile:

2. Here is a progress at learngitbranching.js.org:

![and learngitbranching.js.org Remote Repositories](/task_git_basics/learngitbranching-2.jpg)

*As it seems to me, although visually all these colored circles look logical and nice, but the level of understanding of these tutorials for me personally is worse than the classical course, as was in Udasity, where everything is shown by real examples. As I see it, even the official Git documentation comes out clearer than these exercises. I guess I'm a bit of a retard.*:grimacing:

## Linux CLI, and HTTP
- [x] 1.Linux CLI, and HTTP

1. Linux Survival Guide was pretty interesting and had an nice old-school charm, like in DOS childhood.

2. The HTTP part...
Although in the 2nd part of this article the authors wrote that it was more complicated than the 1st, I found the second part to be much clearer. Maybe because it was more familiar to me than the first one, which was very dry in its description of the request/response messages. I'm going to take a course on Udacity [Networking for Web Developers](https://www.udacity.com/course/networking-for-web-developers--ud256) from the optional materials, where I hope the client-server interaction chain will be described more consistently and with more lively examples.
 
To be able to say where and how I will use the knowledge from this article, I should probably go deeper into the development process itself. The Linux command line is an understandable scenario that is very similar to using the command line for Git. And the HTTP protocol theory will come in handy, as I expect, when we will move on to JS.
