# kottans-frontend

#### Hello! My name is Dmytro. I have previously taken web front-end development courses (including Git basics), but now I want to update and strengthen my knowledge so that I can really try to switch to this new kind of work.

Here is my steps...

# General

1. I've passed Udacity ["Version Control with Git" course](https://learn.udacity.com/courses/ud123).
Here is a progress:

I like it and I've learned that when you're learning Git, it's not always good to use just the terminal for better understanding. While taking the Udasity course, I also used the GUI **GitKraken**, which not only provides a terminal for entering commands, but also visualizes the commit tree and file folders very well, which helps a lot in learning as well.
*By the way, I didn't really like the **GitHub Desktop** app, as it seemed to me rather limited in functionality and the visual part of the process demonstration.* :smile:

Plus, I've passed Coursera Git Intro course and here screens of my first two weeks:

2. Here is a progress at learngitbranching.js.org:

![and learngitbranching.js.org Remote Repositories](/task_git_basics/learngitbranching-remote.jpg)

*As it seems to me, although visually all these colored circles look logical and nice, but the level of understanding of these tutorials for me personally is worse than the classical course, as was in Udasity, where everything is shown by real examples. As I see it, even the official Git documentation comes out clearer than these exercises. I guess I'm a bit of a retard.*:grimacing:

## Linux CLI, and HTTP
- [x] 1.Linux CLI, and HTTP

<details>
<summary>Linux CLI and Networking Progress</summary>  
  
1. Linux Survival Guide was pretty interesting and had an nice old-school charm, like in DOS childhood.

2. The HTTP part...
Although in the 2nd part of this article the authors wrote that it was more complicated than the 1st, I found the second part to be much clearer. Maybe because it was more familiar to me than the first one, which was very dry in its description of the request/response messages. I'm going to take a course on Udacity [Networking for Web Developers](https://www.udacity.com/course/networking-for-web-developers--ud256) from the optional materials, where I hope the client-server interaction chain will be described more consistently and with more lively examples.
 
To be able to say where and how I will use the knowledge from this article, I should probably go deeper into the development process itself. The Linux command line is an understandable scenario that is very similar to using the command line for Git. And the HTTP protocol theory will come in handy, as I expect, when we will move on to JS.

<summary>VCS (hello gitty), GitHub and Collaboration Progress</summary>

1. My Coursera Git Intro Weeks 3 & 4 progress:

2. Here is a progress at advanced parts of the learngitbranching.js.org:

![This is my progress at learngitbranching.js.org Main Advanced](/task_git_collaboration/learngitbranching-main-adv.jpg)
![and learngitbranching.js.org Remote Repositories Advanced](/task_git_collaboration/learngitbranching-remote-adv.jpg)

Even considering that I took all these classes, of course I can't say that everything made perfect sense to me. Even so, it's not so much clear how exactly I can apply it all right now. I'm pretty sure that I can definitely use the git for my project right now and use the basic functions. Commit, make 1-2 branches and merge them, update my local and remote repository. Participate in the public repository a bit. Probably no more than that for now.

This kung-fu with juggling a lot of colored circles (commits), moving them back and forth and etc. I don't dare to do that in a real project right now. Rather, I'm going to try to go in small and incremental steps.

Often, too much functionality gets you stuck. And on these training exercises, there were activities that I have so far had difficulty imagining in real work. Of course, only practice will strengthen my skills and perhaps trigger the need for more complex operations with Git.
